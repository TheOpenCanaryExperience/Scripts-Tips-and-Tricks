# Scripts, Tricks and Tips
This Repo contains some useful tooling for OpenCanary implementations.  Feel free to use the scripts; if you modify them, feel free to stick in this Repo and add versions of the scripts.

### Your OpenCanary will benefit from the following:
- Scripts: There are some useful scripts to be found in /scripts
- Skins: The default skins for basicLogin on HTTP are updated to look nice and to redirect into HTTPS on a Caddy or similar reverse proxy
- Extended VNC.py with thousands of passwords to match (/modules)
- more coming soon


# $HOME
### All good things start from this point.
Scripts will, where possible, stay in the user context.
Where possible, scripts run as the user your OpenCanary is running under.
Within $HOME, you should have samba malware logs and scripts as folders.  If you don't then you need to get modding...
